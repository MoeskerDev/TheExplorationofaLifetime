                <p>To the ancient Romans the planet Mars was symbolic of blood and war but too many people today the red planet may
                hold the key for a bright new future for Humanity the story of Mars began about 4.5 billion
                years ago when gas and dust swirled together to form the fourth planet from the Sun Mars is the second smallest
                planet in the solar system with a diameter just shy of the width of Africa in fact its entire surface area is
                similar to that of all of Earth's continents combined much like its terrestrial cousin Mars is dense and has
                a rocky composition at the center of the planet is a core made of iron nickel and sulphur which may have created a
                protective magnetic field during Mars's earlier years enveloping the core is a rocky mantle made of silicate minerals
                and a crust rich in iron these iron minerals react with the trace amounts of oxygen and Mars's atmosphere and rusts
                giving the planet its signature reddish hue while its blood-like appearance
                inspired the ancient Romans to named Mars after their God of War the planets
                rusty color could be considered symbolic of the planets prime days long past
                today Mars is dry desolate and cold with temperatures dropping as low as negative
                225 degrees Fahrenheit but billions of years ago the planet was much warmer more geologically active and had a
                watery surface lake beds and river valleys snake along the face of Mars indicating that liquid water was for a
                time present volcanoes such as Olympus Mons the largest volcano in the solar system at three times the height of Mount Evererest
                once erupted lava but by about fifty million years ago soon after Earth's dinosaurs died out Mars's volcanoes also
                went extinct water on the red planet still exists today but mostly in the form of polar ice caps because of
                factors such as the presence of water some scientists believe life may have existed on the Red Planet and may exist
                again since the 1960s space program from around the world have launched missions to Mars and attempts to
                understand the planets past present and potential for sustaining life life on
                another planet may well be out of reach for the near future but if any planet could give us hope
                Mars may hold the key to the survival of humanity.</p>

                <p>Over 150 moons orbit the solar system's planets. And one of those moons calls Earth home.
                    The moon was formed about 4.5 billion years ago when, according to one theory, the Earth slammed
                    into another early planet. Debris from this collision began to orbit Earth, and accumulated, forming today's moon.
                    The moon is the fifth largest natural satellite in the solar system, with a diameter just under the width of China.
                    It's composed of an iron rich core, plus a mantle and crust containing minerals made of magnesium, oxygen and silicon.
                    The moon's surface was once geologically active and covered in an ocean of magma.
                    But today, apart from traces of water ice, the surface is completely covered in dust and rocky debris.
                    Countless craters dot the moon's surface. Each formed by objects such as meteroids,
                    comets and asteroids crashing onto the moon. The largest crater, the South Pole Aitkin basin,
                    spans across a quarter of the moon's surface, and is nearly deep enough to fit Mount Everest inside.
                    The moon orbits our planet at an average distance of 30 Earths. It rotates at the same rate that it revolves.
                    So as it revolves around our planet, the same side of the moon faces the Earth at all times.
                    From the Earth's surface, we can observe eight distinct traditionally recognized stages of the moon's illumination, called lunar phases.
                    They have been observed for thousands of years, and even provided the basis for the earliest calendars.
                    For most of human history, the moon could only be studied from afar. But on July 20th, 1969, humans were able to close
                    that distance with the American spaceflight mission Apollo 11. It placed humans on the moon for the very first time.
                    Bringing our understanding of Earth's only natural satellite one step closer.</p>
